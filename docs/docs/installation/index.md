# Installation

## Self-hosted MergeMate
If you choose to host you own MergeMate, you first need to acquire two tokens:

1. An OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), with access to GPT-4 (or a key for [other models](../usage-guide/additional_configurations.md/#changing-a-model), if you prefer).
2. A GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket personal access token (classic), with the repo scope. [GitHub from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)]

There are several ways to use self-hosted MergeMate:

- [Locally](./locally.md)
- [GitHub](./github.md)
- [GitLab](./gitlab.md)
- [BitBucket](./bitbucket.md)
- [Azure DevOps](./azure.md)

## MergeMate Pro ðŸ’Ž
MergeMate Pro, an app for GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket hosted by KhulnaSoft, is also available.

With MergeMate Pro Installation is as simple as signing up and adding the MergeMate app to your relevant repo.
