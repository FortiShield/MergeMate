# ASK Tool

The `ask` tool answers questions about the PR, based on the PR code changes. Make sure to be specific and clear in your questions.
It can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:
```
/ask "..."
```
For example:
___

___
<kbd><img src=https://khulnasoft.com/images/mergemate/ask.png width="768"></kbd>
___

Note that the tool does not have "memory" of previous questions, and answers each question independently.
